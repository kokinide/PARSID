`ReferenceSequencesDatabase_16S_test.fasta` simulates an Reference Sequence Library, containing 25 sequences of the frog family Mantellidae from Madagascar. 
These sequences bear updated taxonomic nomenclature.
**Note**: this example file does not represent the real Mantellidae diversity (more than 500 predicted lineages, Perl et al. 2014) and it is built for simulation purposes.

`Input16S.fasta` includes 10 sequences (of which, one does not belong to Mantellidae) from GenBank with an outdated nomenclature, to simulate the process of molecular species identification.

`Check_tags.csv` includes some examples of check tags to the test.
