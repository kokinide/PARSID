I included in the `ReferenceSequencesDatabase_16S_test.fasta` some sequences of the frog family Mantellidae from Madagascar to simulate a RSL. These sequences have updted taxonomic nomenclature.
**Note**: the example file does not represent the real Mantellidae diversity (approximately 500 lineages).

In the `Input16S.fasta` I included some old sequences from GenBank, which have an outdated nomenclature, to simulate the process of molecular species identification. I also included one sequence that does not belong to Mantellidae.
